# While using public transport we could see simple displays with a ticker.
# It often provides information about next stations and expected arrival time.

# Let's implement a function which will return a chunk of text to be displayed on a display of fixed width.
# The function should take text to display, width of the display and tick as a step of the ticker.
# The function will be called many times with tick parameter constantly incrementing.

# At very beginning the display is empty.
# At first step only one character should be displayed in the most right position and so on.
# When the message is displayed,
# it should be dissapear char by char to left position and return to blank state of the display.
# After that cycle should start again.

# For example
# ticker('Hello world!', 10, 4)   # '      Hell'
# We could expect that our function will be called from simple script like this one

# def demo(text, width):
#     for tick in range(100):
#         someDisplayFunction(ticker(text, width, tick));


def ticker(text, width, tick):
    r = ' ' * width
    pos = 1

    for _ in range(1, tick + 1):
        if r == ' ' * width and pos > len(text):
            pos = 1

        r = ' ' * (width - pos) + text[:pos]
        if pos > width:
            r = r[pos - width :]

            if len(r) < width:
                r += ' ' * (width - len(r))

        if len(r) < width:
            r += ' ' * (width - len(r))

        pos += 1

    return r
